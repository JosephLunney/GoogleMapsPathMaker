# GoogleMapsPathMaker
Records the users path and then shows it to them.

This was the last project I made during the summer where I taught myself android development. 

It records your path as your walk along and then saves it for later viewing. 

I plan on adding a feature where it calculates the distance the user walked. 

Content includes: 
-Google maps API
-Using the Timer class
-Reading and writing to external storage 
-Creating lists in android studio
